[B]0.0.5[/B]
  - Refactor things around a little so that the gui won't load sqlite.
  - Much much faster response for tvdb data, tvdb_api was much too slow (it appears that it doesn't cache correctly?).  
    We now only use it for getting the episode name on a new download.
  - Pickle our fast_cache data on shutdown, and load it again on startup.
  - Create a general module for caching (looks like we're going to be doing a lot of this!)

[B]0.0.4[/B] (2013-09-17)
  - Better handling of ipc timeouts in comms (again, the Pi is the issue here)
  - Rearrange the gui a bit to show more fanart
  - Handle the case where empty tv shows have integer tvdb_id's
  - Rename downloaded file (fixed names for now, this will be a config setting in the future)

[B]0.0.3[/B] (2013-09-16)
  - Workaround for the odd exception on the Pi when getting platform info

[B]0.0.2[/B] (2013-09-13)
  - Very simple (yet mostly functional) gui

[B]0.0.1[/B]
  - Initial, pre-alpha.
