[B]0.0.18[/B] (2013-11-16)
  - Improved handling of 'specials'.  It should at least put them in the correct folder now, even
    if it doesn't know which one they are.
  - switch from using /api/exceptions to /api/scene-names (a bigger collection)
  - disable/remove showrss, 
  - add some backups for EZRSS

[B]0.0.17[/B] (2013-11-09)
  - fix for shows which match on 'no_season', but without a show name.
  - change xbmcvfs.copy to a chunked read/write, in another attempt to workaround the pi lockup
    issue.
  - add web.dl to SDTV.
  - New setting: use_safe_copy to use chunked copy (off by default).
  - Log the episodes included in each download.
  - Don't download an episode that has been downloaded already (even if now gone).
  - Fix the naming system for sequential multipart (wasn't recognised by xbmc if more than 2 eps).
  - Workaround for frodo bug where deleting episodes doesn't fire library change events.
  - Make recent backlogger optional and enable configuration of the number of days back it goes.

[B]0.0.16[/B] (2013-10-30)
  - fix for specials with the same episode number being seen as valid season episodes
  - change the backlogger to use utc dates
  - delete seasons which are no longer on tvdb when refreshing
  - Restrict tvtumbler to one copy/move file operation at a time (to alleviate issues with the Pi)
  - Updates to the readme about the Pi and ShowRSS.
  
[B]0.0.15[/B] (2013-10-09)
  - tidy up the gui a bit
  - put lib path at the start of system path (fix for those with tvdb_api installed already)
  - file copy with timeout (disabled for now, will look into this later)
  - new setting to show images in calendar (off by default)
  - indices on some of the db tables
  - main gui page now checks to see if there are any feeders/downloaders enabled, and prompts for
    settings if not

[B]0.0.14[/B] (2013-10-04)
  - A fix for downloads failing when the download result isn't parsable.
  - Small gui fix for the calendar.

[B]0.0.13[/B] (2013-10-03)
  - Quick bugfix release to help those unfortunate enough to have downloaded the previous :)

[B]0.0.12[/B] (2013-10-03)
  - Preliminary backlog support.  Currently runs backlog search automatically (every 16 hours) for
    anything missed in the last week. (manual backlog on older items to come soon)
  - Lots of little bugs fixed (esp for the Pi - it's almost usable there now)
  
[B]0.0.11[/B] (2013-09-29)
  - Schedule didn't work on the pi before, lots of tweaks now to make it work.  Still terribly slow
    though (and often times out).  Caching improves the situation very much now.
  - Show downloading and downloaded status on the schedule.
  - Cache some of the queries from the epdb.  (we'll need to find a way to make sql faster, it's
    incredibly slow at present).
  - Don't bother querying for so many images (or show status) for the schedule.  We don't use them,
    and they're sloooow!
  - This is a stop-gap release, because some people got caught with a broken version of 0.0.10 
    (downloaded mid-publish).

[B]0.0.10[/B] (2013-09-28)
  - Get year from xbmc if it's available (saves a tvdb lookup)
  - strip dots in scene naming when simplifying (handles cases like "Michael J. Fox" a bit better)
  - Better handling of transmission connection errors, login failures, and other nastiness that can
    happen.
  - TvTumbler will now try to claim downloads from Transmission if they match something it wants.
  - Gui will now prompt to add a tv show when run if you don't have one.
  - Gui will now try to ensure that your tv download dir is set and reasonable (and prompt for a
    new one if not).
  - Progress messages during gui load, and most of the gui is now in dialogs.
  - Save state of running downloads when shut down, and restore it what starting up.
  - Now *really* searches for new shows!
  - New landing page, and simple schedule page.  (Yes, I know they're ugly)

[B]0.0.9[/B] (2013-09-26)
  - Emergency bump to 0.0.9.  Service restart code just freezes on 12.2 (and probably earlier).
    Now just prompt user to restart XBMC on anything less than 13.0.

[B]0.0.8[/B] (2013-09-26)
  - Use the confluence scrollbars and separators.  They're much nicer.
  - Refactor the gui windows so that they share a base class.
  - Basic service handling from the gui: prompt for start if stopped, prompt for restart if out of
    date.
  - Have the housekeeper pull down episode lists when things are quiet.
  - Finally the facility to add new shows (albeit a bit hackish as of yet)
  - Be a bit smarter about accepting show names with a year on the end.
  - Ditto for shows with a country code at the end (using tvrage to check the origin_country)
  - Prettier context menu (stolen from globalsearch addon)
  - Put in a (somewhat ugly) icon for the 'ANY' quality

[B]0.0.7[/B] (2013-09-24)
  - Much better layout/ordering behaviour on downloads screen.
  - Blacklist downloads on failure (so they won't be tried again).  Blacklist entries expire after
    one week.
  - Improve the time formatting on the download screen a little
  - No longer any need for script.module.elementtree (we can now rely on having python 2.6 or 2.7)
  - Do a rudimentary check of transmission settings when they change.  Disable Transmission if they
    fail.
  - If transmission is running locally, "fix" the download location.  (this won't work for remote:
    Download Dir in addon and transmission must agree)
  - Hire a housekeeper: cleans up expired cache entries, and updates the scene exceptions, provided
    xbmc isn't playing.
  - Use "Episode N" for episodes that have no names on tvdb.

[B]0.0.6[/B] (2013-09-23)
  - Small bug in jsonrpc when creating exceptions.
  - New exception 'EpisodeNotFoundException' when querying for a tv episode that is no longer
    present.
  - Add a get_version method to the service. (returns a string like '0.0.6')
  - Have the gui call the get_version when it starts.  If no match, fail to start gui (with warning
    about restart needed)
  - Service can now be stopped by sending it a 'SHUTDOWN' message (just that text, nothing more). 
  - Log start/finish/failure of downloads
  - Very simple (and hackish) gui for downloads

[B]0.0.5[/B] (2013-09-19)
  - Refactor things around a little so that the gui won't load sqlite.
  - Much much faster response for tvdb data, tvdb_api was much too slow (it appears that it doesn't
    cache correctly?).  We now only use it for getting the episode name on a new download.
  - Pickle our fast_cache data on shutdown, and load it again on startup.
  - Create a general module for caching (looks like we're going to be doing a lot of this!)

[B]0.0.4[/B] (2013-09-17)
  - Better handling of ipc timeouts in comms (again, the Pi is the issue here)
  - Rearrange the gui a bit to show more fanart
  - Handle the case where empty tv shows have integer tvdb_id's
  - Rename downloaded file (fixed names for now, this will be a config setting in the future)

[B]0.0.3[/B] (2013-09-16)
  - Workaround for the odd exception on the Pi when getting platform info

[B]0.0.2[/B] (2013-09-13)
  - Very simple (yet mostly functional) gui

[B]0.0.1[/B]
  - Initial, pre-alpha.
